### Summary
Through the use of viral falsehood and digital manipulation, determined actors can destabilize civil institutions, affect social polarization, or disrupt rival militaries. As social media has proliferated, so has the use of these new stratagems. We isolate and define this phenomenon, which we describe as “political disinformation campaigns.” We also propose and test a classification system built on 150 variable options. Our intent is to establish a replicable, extensible system by which widely disparate disinformation campaigns can be categorized and compared. 

### Introduction
Through the deliberate seeding and manipulation of viral falsehood, a determined actor can destabilize civil institutions, affect social polarization and inflame ethnic and religious tensions, disrupt or demoralize rival militaries, sabotage foreign economies, or simply abuse the nature of digital advertising for personal financial gain. This phenomenon is broadly known as “digital disinformation” (hereafter referred to as “disinformation”). Today, at least 70 national governments or national-level political parties have invested in such information manipulation capabilities (Bradshaw & Howard 2019), as have innumerable individuals and business interests.

As the potency and prominence of disinformation has grown, several frameworks have been proposed to contextualize and understand it. These frameworks have been designed with different ends in mind. Wardle & Derakhshan (2017) take the most expansive view, identifying disinformation as just one contributor, alongside mis- and mal-information, to a state of “information disorder.”

Other frameworks emphasize narrative analysis and deconstruction. Pamment et al. (2018) provide a diagnostic of “influence activities” conducted by foreign powers, of which disinformation is a subset. They divide each discrete campaign into rhetorical strategies (positive, negative or oblique); techniques (forging and leaking to deceptive identities); and influence stratagems (black propaganda to polarization to flooding). By applying this framework, policymakers can formulate more effective counter-messages.

Still other frameworks offer greater granularity and narrower ends. Bradshaw & Howard (2017; 2018; 2019) have created an evolving schema of organizational forms, account types, and general strategies that describe both disinformation campaigns and related information manipulation techniques. This system helps describe and differentiate national approaches to the digital commons. Martin & Shapiro (2019) present a detailed classification system for online foreign influence efforts by which attacker characteristics, tactics, and rhetorical tactics, and platform choice can be assessed and compared.

Even amid this abundance of studies and frameworks, however, critical gaps remain. By casting a wide net (e.g. “influence activities”), some frameworks fail to distinguish disinformation from state propaganda or illicit financial pressure, which have much longer histories. By placing heavy emphasis on rhetorical and narrative classification, many frameworks also elude useful application to non-Western nations, in which foreign researchers may be unfamiliar with the language and local political context. Because many frameworks focus exclusively on the activities of adversarial powers, they do not address the challenge of classifying disinformation campaigns of domestic origin.

We have created and applied a new framework for disinformation classification. This framework is intended to be replicable and extensible, able to describe and compare widely disparate campaigns. This short paper proceeds in three parts: a presentation of definitions, an explanation of case selection and methodology, and a discussion of initial project observations and areas for further research. The project codebook itself is contained in Appendix A. 

### Definition
We define <i>disinformation</i> as “false or misleading information, spread with the intention to deceive” (Nimmo 2018). This definition captures both falsehood and deception by means of decontextualization. This definition also emphasizes intentionality. Contrary to some competing definitions, we make no claims with relation to the purpose of the disinformation.

We define <i>political disinformation</i> as “disinformation with a political or politically adjacent end.” This definition captures disinformation spread in the course of an election, protest, or military operation. It also captures the widespread phenomenon of political “clickbait” disseminated for personal financial gain.

Finally, we define a <i>political disinformation campaign</i> as “political disinformation that demonstrates both coordination and a discrete objective.” As objectives change over time, it becomes possible to delineate one political disinformation campaign from another. Note that while a discrete objective will always exist, it may not always be discernible.

Although not explicated in the definition, political disinformation campaigns almost always evidence the inauthentic amplification of content: what Heller et al. (2019) call “political astroturfing” and what Facebook identifies as “coordinated inauthentic behavior” (Gleicher 2018). Although inauthentic amplification is not “disinformation” per se, it is intended to create an illusion of consensus or popularity, and is therefore inextricably linked to political disinformation campaigns. Selected cases do not include instances of political misinformation, in which evidence of coordination or intent is absent.

### Case Selection and Methodology

We have established two criteria for case selection. First, a case must meet the definition of a political disinformation campaign. This is done by means of inter-coder agreement, with guidance from the principle investigator.

Second, the case must be drawn from a trustworthy secondary source. By coding the work and conclusions of other researchers, we can mitigate—although not eliminate—appearances of an opaque or arbitrary classification process. This is especially important because of the reputational risk that comes with false attribution of political disinformation campaigns.

In this initial project phase, we used DFRLab publications for all coded cases. This ensured source consistency and certainty regarding the rigor of research processes. As the project develops further, we envision the inclusion of cases from trusted publications and research institutions. This “trusted” status will be established by means of the nine NewsGuard credibility and transparency standards, or a similarly well-regarded system of source evaluation.

Following case selection, we built a system of classification. This framework was developed in an iterative process. Coders used test cases to expand upon definitions and refine the taxonomy. Cases were classified by two coders and inter-coder reliability was tracked to ensure consistent application of categories and definitions. Variables that were not consistently applied were refined or removed.

Ultimately, we created a system with 76 binary variables, 35 text descriptors, and 40 quantitative variables. This system classifies political disinformation campaigns through six categories: Target, Platforms, Content, Methods, Attribution, and Intent. This order reflects the process by which the DFRLab identifies and evaluates suspected campaigns.

+ [Target](#target) describes the national or supranational characteristics of the target, to include its political or social strata.
+ [Platform](#platforms) describes the medium through which the disinformation is conveyed, to include open web, social media, and messaging services.
+ [Content](#content) describes the language and topic of the disinformation.
+ [Methods](#methods) describes the tactics and narrative techniques that are used to disseminate the disinformation.
+ [Attribution](#attribution) describes the national or supranational characteristics of the disinformant, to include its political or social strata, as well as the confidence of the attribution.
+ [Intent](#intent) describes the inferred purpose of the political disinformation campaign.

The question of attribution required particular attention. The system delineates between two levels of attribution to state actors. The first level is a declaration by a social media platform or a trusted government entity, which have access to signals intelligence and other publicly unavailable information. The second level is attribution to a state proxy, based either on a credible third-party assessment or the informed evaluation of a DFRLab researcher.

Such DFRLab evaluation is based on a close study of open-source evidence, including how directly a campaign can be tied to specific, named actors. The more compelling and clear these connections, the higher the confidence of this assessment. In many cases, no affirmative attribution can be made.

We proceeded to code 60 cases through application of this framework. Cases were classified by two coders and inter-coder reliability was tracked. In addition to a close reading of the associated article, coders also followed hyperlinks to open-source evidence (when available) to determine any additional language or platform uses. Coder disagreement was resolved by the principle investigator.

### Initial Observations & Areas for Further Research
Many of the most striking initial observations in the dataset do not regard the character of individual campaigns, but rather the process of the coding itself. Because DFRLab case studies are reflective of the broader field of disinformation studies, this process is revealing about the state of the discipline as a whole.

By a significant margin, the most targeted nation in the dataset is the United States (eight). The second-most targeted is Indonesia (four), followed by Venezuela and Mexico (three each). The most targeted region as a whole is the Middle East (three). A quarter of campaigns (15) had more than one target nation or region recorded. The electorate was the target in an overwhelming number of cases (52), followed by civilian government (11) and political party (10). There were 13 domestic cases, all of which targeted categories that included the electorate. At least one concurrent event was coded in the majority of cases (44). As a whole, inter-coder agreement on target binaries was 91 percent.

The most popular disinformation platform in the dataset is Facebook (39), followed by Twitter (30). One-third of cases made use of “junk news” websites (20). As a whole, inter-coder agreement on platform binaries was 96 percent: the highest across the project.

Regarding the content of political disinformation campaigns, the most common language was English (31), followed by Spanish (16) and Russian (9). The overwhelming topic focus was on government (47), followed by political parties (29). The third most common topic was racial, ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities (17), reflecting the frequent marginalization of vulnerable groups in political disinformation campaigns. As a whole, inter-coder agreement on content binaries was 82 percent.


The technical and rhetorical methods of disinformation were the most difficult to assess in a consistent fashion. The most common technical tactic was the use of sockpuppets (32), followed by botnets (18) and brigading (15). Constructive narratives were by far the most common, both in order to astroturf (36) and activate real supporters of a movement (21). Destructive narratives were also common, both for the purpose of discrediting (28) and suppression of political opposition (5). As a whole, inter-coder agreement on methods binaries was 87 percent.

In attribution of political disinformation campaigns, two clear disinformants stood out: Russia (9) and Iran (7). Campaigns were most often attributed to government entities, either via direct attribution (10), or via indirect attribution to proxies working on the government’s behalf (16). A number of business entities (7) also participated in political disinformation. Although the average campaign length of a case in our dataset was 2.5 years, the average length of a Russian nation of origin campaign was 6.2 years, and 5.2 years for Iran. The third most often attributed power was Venezuela (3). As a whole, inter-coder agreement on attribution binaries was 92 percent.

Finally, regarding the intent of political disinformation campaigns, two-thirds sought to alter the target’s civil institutions (40). Nearly as many carried a discernible social objective (36). Few were conducted in direct support of military campaigns (6), and just one had an obvious economic objective. As a whole, inter-coder agreement on intent binaries was 84 percent.

Given a popular focus on Russia as the world’s primary disinformant, it was surprising to see Iran rank nearly as high in the dataset. It was also surprising, given a widespread obsession with “bots” as the source of disinformation, that less than one-third of cases employed obvious botnets. More predictable was the high number of destructive narratives, spread with the intent of discrediting particular individuals or institutions. Such negative goals remain the principle use of political disinformation campaigns.

There are clear limitations to this project, however. As a consequence of our definition, the number of political disinformation campaigns is potentially inexhaustible. Because of our case selection system, political disinformation campaigns may also overlap. This means that any comparative conclusion from our dataset (e.g. “Russia conducts more disinformation operations than Iran”) cannot be sufficiently substantiated. It also means, because less reporting is available on cases that target the Global South, that certain nations are over- or underrepresented in this database.

The intention of this project has been to construct and evaluate a new schema for the classification of political disinformation campaigns that is both replicable and extensible. Ideally, this system might be applied by other academic institutions and journalistic outlets.

The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a large database of political disinformation campaigns. Researchers, policymakers, journalists, and concerned citizens might analyze this database for insights into the aggregate functions of disinformation campaigns. This will assist in the effort to identify and isolate these campaigns before they take form.

In the context of political disinformation campaigns, this is the acquisition of sensitive information through spearphishing or similar techniques that can be subsequently released by the disinformant to boost their messaging effort.</i></li>
      </ol>
      <li type="A"> Deceptive Content Manipulation (binary). <i>Any content that has been deceptively edited by use of Photoshop or similar software.
